      <h1>Our mission</h1>
        <p>
           We are a couple living in the Pasadena area. Our passion is fitness.
           We aim to give people all the tools they need to achieve a world
           class physique. Health is our number one priority and will never be
           sacrificed in order to achieve results. There are no shortcuts.
           However; with a well planned workout program and personally tailored
           nutrition plan you are able to manipulate your body's metabolism and
           hormonal responses to stack the chips in your favor, putting your
           body in the right ,<strong><em>"mode"</em> </strong>to burn fat and put on muscle. There is so
           much more to it than simply eating healthy and wokring out. Let us
           tech you.
